I am writing to you today with a heavy heart to seek your compassionate understanding and kind consideration for a matter of utmost importance.\n \nAs you may already be aware, a tragic incident within our Pangasinan State University community has left us all deeply saddened and concerned. One of our fellow students, Ms. Lowilyn Caido Caniedo, 22 years old and a graduating student of BSHM, a vibrant and promising young individual, has recently become a victim of a horrific crime—a rape-slay incident. This deplorable act has not only shaken us as a university family but has also sparked an overwhelming desire amongst the student body to extend our support and solidarity to the affected student’s family during these trying times.\n \nIn light of this situation, we, the Supreme Student Council, along with various campus organizations of the CTHM, have come together with a shared objective—to alleviate the financial burden that the bereaved family is facing. With your benevolent permission, we wish to initiate a voluntary donation drive on campus to raise funds to assist the grieving family with funeral expenses and other essential needs.\n \nThe donation drive will be done through a room-to-room campaign as well as through Gcash Donations. We assure you that all funds raised through this donation drive will be utilized solely for the aforementioned purposes.\n \nWe firmly believe that the strength of our university lies not only in its academic excellence but also in the compassion and solidarity we extend to our fellow students and their families during times of distress. Your kind permission for this noble cause will undoubtedly go a long way in fostering a sense of empathy and support within our university community.\n \nThank you for taking the time to read our heartfelt appeal.

All subjects shall be delivered asynchronously. All laboratory and research activities shall be\ndone a week alter.\n\n2. Related learning experiences, student internships, and practice teaching are NOT covered\nin the short-term shift since they will be completing the required hours for the subject.\nHowever, in cases where the partner Host Training Establishments (HTEs) have integrated\nremote work modalities, including synchronous/asynchronous options in the internship\nprogram, the equivalent hours shall be included in reckoning the total number of hours.\n\n3. Faculty members shall work from a work-from-home arrangement. However, in exigency of\nservice, faculty members may be required to report onsite to work on accreditation,\nassessment-related responsibilities, and related activities.\n\n4.All faculty members with designations and non-teaching personnel shall report onsite.\n\n5. The department chairperson and college dean shall monitor their respective faculty. The\ncollege dean shall submit the monitoring reports to the office of the Campus Executive\nDirector.\n\nAdditionally, a Work-from-Home (WFH) arrangement will be in effect on April 16, 2025\n(Wednesday). However, frontline service offices shall observe a skeleton workforce to ensure\nthe continuity of the university's operations. The work-from-home arrangement does not cover\nsecurity, utility, and maintenance personnel under the general services office.\n\nEmployees are expected to perform their duties and ensure that all deliverables and\nresponsibilties are met during this period.\n\nFor information and guidance.\n\nELBERT M.
