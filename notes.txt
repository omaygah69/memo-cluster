stopword problem:
    Stop words are the words in a stop list (or stoplist or negative dictionary) which are filtered out ("stopped") before or after processing of natural language data (i.e. text) because they are deemed to have little semantic value or are otherwise insignificant for the task at hand.

From our first output we have this results:
=== Cluster 0 ===
Top keywords: examination, evaluation, december, midterm, 00, shall, final, ge, instructional, student

=== Cluster 1 ===
Top keywords: student, ssc, campus, lingayen, lc, supreme, council, psu, pangasinan, approval

=== Cluster 2 ===
Top keywords: campus, student, college, university, faculty, lingayen, pangasinan, office, member, year

The things is we have words like "students", "psu", "lingayen", "pangasinan" which is makikita mo naman sa almost lahat ng memos
we can call them stopwords which is redundant or insignificant sa model.

TF‑IDF: a feature extraction / weighting method that converts raw text into a sparse vector where each dimension corresponds to a term;
values reflect term frequency scaled by inverse document frequency (term importance per document).
TruncatedSVD: a linear dimensionality‑reduction technique (low‑rank approximation of the term matrix via singular value decomposition) that projects high‑dimensional data into a lower‑dimensional dense space (captures latent global structure).

Use TF‑IDF when you want interpretable, sparse term features for classic classifiers (logistic regression, SVM) or retrieval.
Use TruncatedSVD when you want compact dense representations (reduced dimensionality), to speed downstream models, or to capture latent semantics (often applied after TF‑IDF to form LSA/LSI).

Semantic coherence:
Cluster 0 → approvals, financial, requests.
Cluster 1 → events, training, participation.
Cluster 2 → exams and schedules.
Cluster 3 → instructional materials and evaluation.
Cluster 4 → dress code / employee attire.
Cluster 5 → online classes and modalities.
Cluster 6 → meetings, officers, agendas.


UMAP vs t-SNE for this task

UMAP advantages

Faster and scales better to thousands of documents.
Preserves both local and global structure better (clusters don’t “float randomly”).
Works directly on sparse TF-IDF matrices (no .toarray() needed).
t-SNE advantages
Often produces “cleaner blobs” in 2D/3D, which look nice for presentations.
Very good at preserving local neighborhoods.

t-SNE disadvantages
Much slower, especially in 3D.
Sensitive to hyperparameters (like perplexity).
Less consistent: different runs can yield slightly different embeddings.

choice: Stick with UMAP 3D for speed + scalability.
